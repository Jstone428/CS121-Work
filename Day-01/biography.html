<h1>The Life of Jessica Stone</h1>

<h1></h1>

<h3>Birth</h3>

<p>I was born in West Hills, CA on April 28, 1994. I&#39;ve lived in the same house my entire life. </p>

<h3>Family</h3>

<p>My <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=554568141268021&amp;set=t.1460494258&amp;type=3&amp;theater">immediate family</a> consists of my father, Julian; my mother, Barbara; and my sister, Molly. We also rescued a puppy 8 years ago, named Rupert.  </p>

<h3>Currently</h3>

<p><img src="http://athletics.macalester.edu/images/2013/9/15/jessica_stone_14.jpg" alt="Head Shot"/></p>

<p>I attend <a href="http://www.macalester.edu">Macalester College</a> in Saint Paul, MN. I am a sophomore student-athlete on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDgIm25b3_M">Women&#39;s Varsity Golf team</a> and I participate in club sports as well. Most of my day is spent at the Leonard Center and it has become my favorite building. This year, I live with three of my closest friends in a suite. </p>

<h3>Before Mac</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve lived at my current house in Granada Hills, CA for my entire life so far. For elementary and middle school, I attended St. Euphrasia; and for high school, I attended Notre Dame High School. I enjoyed both schools, but I knew that college would be a better time for me. </p>

<p>From elementary through high school, community service was a huge part of my life. I would volunteer with animal shelters, homeless shelters, different projects, and participate in the JDRF Walk. </p>

<h3><a href="http://www.impactpersonalsafety.com/">IMPACT: Personal Safety</a></h3>

<p>Sophomore year of high school, my mom had me enrolled in a self-defense class. This self-defense class was not of a martial arts style. IMPACT was a women&#39;s self-defense class, meaning that it was specifically tailored to women and focused on our strengths. I participated in this class for 6 weeks. After taking this class, I am more confident in myself. IMPACT holds the fundamental truth that <a href="http://www.impactpersonalsafety.com/impact/who-we-are/">&ldquo;your life is worth fighting for&rdquo;</a>. IMPACT is <a href="http://www.impactpersonalsafety.com/impact/why/">empowering</a>, and I encourage women, and even men, to take their classes. This class is what sparked my desire to study WGSS. </p>
