I attend [Macalester College](http://www.macalester.edu) in Saint Paul, MN. I am a sophomore student-athlete on the [Women's Varsity Golf team](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDgIm25b3_M) and I participate in club sports as well. Most of my day is spent at the Leonard Center and it has become my favorite building. This year, I live with three of my closest friends in a suite.

## Before Mac

I've lived at my current house in Granada Hills, CA for my entire life so far. For elementary and middle school, I attended St. Euphrasia; and for high school, I attended Notre Dame High School. I enjoyed both schools, but I knew that college would be a better time for me.

From elementary through high school, community service was a huge part of my life. I would volunteer with animal shelters, homeless shelters, different projects, and participate in the JDRF Walk. 

## [IMPACT: Personal Safety](http://www.impactpersonalsafety.com/)

Sophomore year of high school, my mom had me enrolled in a self-defense class. This self-defense class was not of a martial arts style. IMPACT was a women's self-defense class, meaning that it was specifically tailored to women and focused on our strengths. I participated in this class for 6 weeks. After taking this class, I am more confident in myself. IMPACT holds the fundamental truth that ["your life is worth fighting for"](http://www.impactpersonalsafety.com/impact/who-we-are/). IMPACT is [empowering](http://www.impactpersonalsafety.com/impact/why/), and I encourage women, and even men, to take their classes. This class is what sparked my desire to study WGSS.
